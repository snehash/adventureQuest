# adventureQuest
A fun, interactive career finding tool for middle schoolers. 

What is it?
---------------

adventureQuest is a hackathon project which allows middle school students a fun way to explore career options. We have implemented a choose your own adventure story based on a RIASEC test, allowing students to indentify their strengths and weakenesses based on the decisions they make. At the end of the story, the students will be given some suggested career options based on these strengths. The story has many different paths so students may also opt to go through the story multiple times and explore different career options. This project has been implemented using a responsive web application so that it is easy to view and use on mobile platforms as well.

Project Specifications
-------------------------

"Imagine a colorful, student-friendly maker space filled with students tinkering on engineering projects, making robo-crafts that bring together their knowledge of coding with their imagination for art and design. Now imagine this space being located in a lab of a large tech organization, so that students can see how what they learned applies to the world of work, specifically as it relates to STEM careers. Qualcommâ€™s Thinkabit Lab, once a dream but now a reality, is a platform to engage middle school students in engineering. Now established, the next step is to take the platform and share it across industries to create awareness around the various STEM based pathways.

We need your help to take our mission and tools mobile, furthering our reach to the thousands of students who do not make it physically into the lab. We are looking for an interactive platform to help students identify what their strengths, interests, and values are, helping them determine what a potential career path might look like. We have a rich array of information (career path videos, survey tools, website, etc.) that need to be packaged together to have the biggest impact. We just need the right innovative minds who can package it together. Are you up for the challenge?"
